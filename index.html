              My journey of development began in 2022. I was interested in doing this because of all the jobs I can get with this field, and I have taken programming classes in
              high school. I am set to graduate from the Harrisburg Area Community College, where I have not had a course grade below A. I listed 0 years of experience because I have
              never had a job in the WEB department, but hopefully my first job will be with you. I am more of a backend developer than I am a frontend developer, but if you need
              a frontend or full-stack developer, I know you can rely on me to get the job done for you.

              There are also three images in each page. There is an area that shows you Super Bowl championships, NFC championships, and NFC West titles.
              I like the way I made them readable by putting them in new lines as well as making the important things bold.

              There isn't that many impressive things in this project. The thing I'm most proud of myself for is adding the Office application icons to the navigation bar at the top.
              I also used Bootstrap in this assignment which is how I was able to do that in the first place.
              I liked that I used a button group for the navigation bar which makes it look better than a standard navigation bar.
              There are also breadcrumbs in each page of the assignment which I liked.

              This was the very first assignment where I used Bootstrap which is why I put it here.
              I used tables to show the standings for the 2022 MLB season, and I discussed some history of the four divisions I chose.
              Each table column shows a standing, logo, record, and postseason result from 2022. This was made on October 24, 2022, so the World Series hadn't been started yet.

              In this assignment, I was told to create a unit like my HACC professor Eric Yoxheimer organizes his units.
              I created an introduction page, basic HTML structure page, other HTML elements page, a final points page, as well as an assignment page.
              I put this here because I like the minimalistic design I used for WordPress. I grabbed this theme off of the WordPress catalog, and using code tags is easy with this.
              I did also enjoy being able to make my own unit and assignment instructions. Click the top left of the page to view other pages.

              In this assignment, I used transitions all over my assignment. If you go around hovering things on each page, you may notice something change.
              I put this here because I really liked being able to put in silly transitions into my assignments to make them more fun.
              This also shows I am able to use transitions. I have worked with them in my WEB 125 course in 2022, but this one is more recent.
