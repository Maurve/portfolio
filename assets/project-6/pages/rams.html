            The Rams were founded in 1936 as the Cleveland Rams. They didn't last long there as they moved to Los Angeles in 1946, letting Paul Brown's Cleveland Browns take over.
            The Rams played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum until 1980. They moved to St. Louis in 1994.
            Five years later, they won their first Super Bowl as they defeated the Titans in one of the best Super Bowls ever 23-16.
            Two years later, they lost to the Patriots in the Super Bowl 20-17.
            They had major failures after this year, making the playoffs only once within the next 16 years. They moved back to Los Angeles in 2016.
            In 2017, they finally made the playoffs for the first time in 14 years but lost in the Wild Card round to the Falcons.
            In 2018, they lost to the Patriots again in the Super Bowl.
            In 2021, they won the Super Bowl in their second season in SoFi Stadium, defeating the Bengals 23-20.
