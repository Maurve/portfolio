            The Seahawks were founded in 1976 as an expansion team. They have played their games at Lumen Field since 2002. They used to play at the Kingdome (1976-1999) and Husky Stadium (1994 and 2000-2001).
            They used to be a part of the AFC from 1977 to 2001 until the division realignment occurred in which the Seahawks were played in the NFC West.
            The Seahawks won their first NFC title in 2005 but lost in the Super Bowl to the Steelers with some questionable calls going in favor of Pittsburgh.
            In 2013, they destroyed the Broncos 43-8 to win their first Super Bowl title.
            In 2014, they made the Super Bowl for the second straight year but lost to the Patriots 28-24 after Wilson threw an interception at the 1-yard line.
