            The Cardinals were founded in 1898 as the Chicago Cardinals and joined the NFL as a charter member in 1920.
            They moved to Arizona in 1988 and played their home games at Sun Devil Stadium until 2006 when they moved to State Farm Stadium and have been there ever since.
            The Cardinals have never won a Super Bowl. They only made it to one Super Bowl which was in 2008, but they lost to the Steelers in a thrilling game 27-23.
            They last made the NFC Championship in 2015 but were torn apart by the Panthers 49-15.
            They have only made it to the playoffs once since then, and that was in 2021 where they lost to the Rams in the Wild Card round 34-11.
