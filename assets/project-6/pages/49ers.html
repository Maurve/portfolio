            The 49ers were founded in 1946 as members of the All-America Football Conference and joined the NFL in 1949. They were the first professional sports franchise to be based in San Francisco.
            They played their games in Candlestick Park from 1971 to 2013 before moving to Levi's Stadium in 2014 where they have been playing ever since.
            They won 5 Super Bowls between 1981 to 1994 with hall of famers Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott, Steve Young, Charles Haley, Fred Dean, Bill Walsh, and George Seifert.
            Their next two Super Bowls were both losses in 2012 (Ravens) and 2020 (Chiefs). They won the NFC West in 2022 but lost to the Eagles in the NFC Championship.
